### 1. Downloading the data
In this example, I will use the [Speical Database 19](https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-special-database-19) published by the [National Institute for Standards And Technology](https://www.nist.gov/). It contains over 800,000 pre-classified images of handwritten letters and digits. It differentiates between 47 classes: All uppercase letters, all numbers and a few lower case letters. I downloaded the `by_merge.zip` file and saved in in my projects folder. To make working with the files easier, I wrote [a python script]() to move all the images into the same folder and rename them `class_[class]_index_[index].jpeg`, for example `class_25_Index_3743.jpeg`.
